# Udacity Machine Learning DevOps Engineer Nanodegree
This is Udacity Machine Learning DevOps Engineer Nanodegree personal repo. This contains the projects built in this nanodegree to build DevOps skills required to automate the various aspects and stages of machine learning model building and monitoring.

[Project 1: Predict Customer Churn with Clean Code](https://github.com/msinha251/Udacity_Machine_Learning_DevOps_Engineer_Nanodegree/tree/main/1_Clean_code_principals)
In this project, you will implement your learnings to identify credit card customers that are most likely to churn. The completed project will include a Python package for a machine learning project that follows coding (PEP8) and engineering best practices for implementing software (modular, documented, and tested). The package will also have the flexibility of being run interactively or from the command-line interface (CLI).

This project will give you practice using your skills for testing, logging, and best coding practices from this lesson. It will also introduce you to a problem data scientists across companies face all the time. How do we identify (and later intervene with) customers who are likely to churn?
