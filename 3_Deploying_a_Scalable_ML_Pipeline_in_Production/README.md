## Recap Lesson 2: Performance Testing and Preparing a Model for Production

**Data Slicing**: It is when we compute the metrics of our model holding certain fixed features.

Typical model validation such as validation sets and **K-Fold Cross-Validation** can be thought of as looking at **horizontal slices of the data**, i.e. an overall view of the data and performance. **Data slicing** can be thought of as looking at **vertical slices of the data**.
